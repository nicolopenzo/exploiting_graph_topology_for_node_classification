# Exploiting graph topology for node classification
In this work, we propose an ''historical trip'' in the possible solutions to performe node classification over graph, starting from handcrafted features to end-to-end learning systems. The task is performed over the citation datasets CORA, CiteSeer and PubMed. You can identify three different jupyter notebook:

* **OrbitDegreeVector.ipynb** : baseline (only textual features), textual + graphlet degree vector features;

* **node2vec_node_classification.ipynb** : solution where only topological features are exploited, using node2vec embeddings + simple classifier (LR, SVM or shallow NN);

* **Project_GNN** : solution where different kinds of GNNs (based on GCN and GAT layers) are exploited.
